Assignments for the Complex Data Analysis course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

1. Collective classification 
Iterative Classification Algorithm - implementation and experiments.

2. Hierarchical classification
  - Dataset: [LINK](https://sites.google.com/site/hrsvmproject/datasets-hier)
  - Exploration of different approaches to hierarchical classification: LCN (Local classifier per node), LCPN (Local Classifier per Parent Node), LCL (Local Classifier per Level), Big Bang.

3. Concept drift detection <br>
Detection of distribution change on stream data implemented with following methods: DDM, ADWIN, PageHinkley, HDDM_A, KSWIN from [scikit-multiflow] (https://scikit-multiflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/api.html)

4. Time series
Prediction of time series for last 12 values. Prediction was performed with ARIMA model (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average).

Remark: Comments inside notebooks in polish.
